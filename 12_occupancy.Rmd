## Exercises {#occupancy-exercises}

Is 5 observers a good cut-off point, or do we loose a lot of information?

What happens if you only use stationary counts? Or reduce the distance traveled to 1km?

We defined a site by the location only. How do our results differ if we define a site by the location and unique observer?

Could we sample more then one checklist per grid cell?

Extra: Sample individual checklists in a grid cell to create the detection history
