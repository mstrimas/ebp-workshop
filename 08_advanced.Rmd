## Custom downloads {#advanced-custom}

The full EBD is massive (over 200 GB) and takes a long time to process with `auk` (typically several hours). In some cases, there is a way around these issues. On the [EBD download page](https://ebird.org/data/download/ebd), there is a Custom Download form that allows you to only download a subset of the EBD for a given species, within a region, and for a range of dates. After submitting this form, the request will be processed on the eBird servers and a email will be sent to you with instructions for downloading the EBD extract.

Recall from the [lesson on zero-filling](#presabs--filter), that we extracted American Flamingo records from Mexico's Yucat√°n state in January, and produced presence-absence data from this extract. Let's try to do this with the Custom Download form. After the request is submitted an email will arrive with instrustions for [downloading the following file](https://github.com/mstrimas/ebp-workshop/raw/master/raw-data/ebd_MX-YUC_grefla2_201501_201612_relApr-2019.zip). Download and unarchive this file, placing the text file in the `data/` subdirectory of your project.

```{r advanced-custom-dl}
tf <- "data/temp.zip"
download.file("https://github.com/mstrimas/ebp-workshop/raw/master/raw-data/ebd_MX-YUC_grefla2_201501_201612_relApr-2019.zip", tf)
```

It will quickly become clear that there are two issues with this approach. First, the set of filters available in the Custom Download form is limited. For example, there's no option to only extract observations from complete checklists or any way to get observations from a given month from any year. To add
