["introduction.html", "Lesson 1 Introduction", " Lesson 1 Introduction We start with a short presentation giving and introduction to eBird and the motivation behind the auk package. The presentation can be downloaded in PowerPoint format or viewed on SpeakerDeck. "],
["setup.html", "Lesson 2 Setup 2.1 Tidyverse", " Lesson 2 Setup Before we dive into writing code, let’s take a few minutes to ensure our systems are correctly set up with all the correct software and R packages. Devoting some time to this up front will reduce errors and make troubleshooting easier later in the workshop. Start by opening a browser window with three tabs pointing to the following websites: The eBird homepage The auk website. This R package is used to access eBird data and we’ll be using the website to access help and resources. The etherpad for this workshop. This is a collaborative notepad similar to Google Docs, which we can use to share code and links. Make sure you can edit the document. Checkpoint Are all tabs correctly opened? Can you edit the etherpad? Next install or update RStudio, then open it up. Look at the top line of the console, which gives your R version; copy that over to the etherpad. If you have a version older than 3.5.0, update R. Checkpoint Is your R version at least 3.5.0? Do you need help updating R? Create a new RStudio project called ebird-best-practices. Next, install all the packages required for this workshop and part II, by running the following code: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;mstrimas/ebppackages&quot;) As mentioned in the introduction, the auk package uses the unix command line tool AWK to extract data from eBird. AWK comes installed by default on Mac OS and Linux systems, but Windows users will need to install it. To do so, install the Cygwin software. Checkpoint Is AWK installed? Run the following code to test that auk is installed correctly and AWK is working: library(auk) library(tidyverse) tf &lt;- tempfile() system.file(&quot;extdata/ebd-sample.txt&quot;, package = &quot;auk&quot;) %&gt;% auk_ebd() %&gt;% auk_species(species = c(&quot;Canada Jay&quot;, &quot;Blue Jay&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_country(country = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_bbox(bbox = c(-100, 37, -80, 52)) %&gt;% auk_date(date = c(&quot;2012-01-01&quot;, &quot;2012-12-31&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_time(start_time = c(&quot;06:00&quot;, &quot;09:00&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_duration(duration = c(0, 60)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(tf) %&gt;% read_ebd() %&gt;% pull(common_name) %&gt;% message() unlink(tf) It should print Blue Jay. Checkpoint Did “Blue Jay” print without errors? If you’re running into any setup issues that can’t be resolved, use RStudio Cloud for this workshop instead. 2.1 Tidyverse Throughout this workshop, we’ll be using functions from the Tidyverse. This is an opinionated set of packages for working with data in R. Packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 are part of the Tidyverse. I’ll try to explain any functions I use as they come up; however, there’s one important operator from the Tidyverse that needs to be explaied up front: the pipe operator %&gt;%. The pipe operator takes the expression to the left of it and “pipes” it into the first argument of the expression on the right. # without pipe mean(1:10) #&gt; [1] 5.5 # with pipe 1:10 %&gt;% mean() #&gt; [1] 5.5 The value of the pipe operator becomes more clean when we have several operations in a row. # without pipes ran_norm &lt;- rnorm(10, sd = 5) ran_norm_pos &lt;- abs(ran_norm) ran_norm_sort &lt;- sort(ran_norm_pos) ran_norm_round &lt;- round(ran_norm_sort, digits = 1) ran_norm_round #&gt; [1] 0.9 1.5 1.6 2.4 2.9 3.1 3.7 4.1 4.2 8.0 # with pipes rnorm(10, sd = 5) %&gt;% abs() %&gt;% sort() %&gt;% round(digits = 1) #&gt; [1] 0.1 0.2 1.9 3.0 3.1 4.1 4.7 5.6 7.6 11.1 Checkpoint Any questions about the pipe? Exercise Rewrite the following code using pipes: round(exp(diff(log(runif(10, min = 0.5)))), 1) Solution runif(10, min = 0.5) %&gt;% log() %&gt;% exp() %&gt;% round(digits = 1) #&gt; [1] 0.9 0.8 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.5 0.7 0.9 0.8 "],
["access.html", "Lesson 3 Data Access", " Lesson 3 Data Access The complete eBird database is provided via the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD), a large tab-separated text file. To start working with eBird data, we need to download this file. To access the EBD, you will need to create an eBird account and sign in to eBird. Once signed in, from the eBird homepage, click on the Science tab then scroll down to click on Using eBird for science in the right-hand menu. This page compiles links to a variety datasets, tools, and educational material for using eBird data to do science; it’s a great resource! On the following page, proceed to the eBird Basic Dataset page. If you haven’t already done so, you will need to submit a request to access the EBD. You can do this after the workshop if you haven’t already done so. From this page you can download the eBird Basic Dataset, a large tab-separated text file that contains (nearly) every eBird observation. In this file, each row corresponds to an observation of a species on a checklist. On this page, you can also download the Sampling Event Data. In this file, each row corresponds to a checklist rather than a species observation. We’ll see why this file is important later in the workshop. The EBD is huge, so don’t download these files now. Instead, we’ll be working with a small subset of the data today, which can be downloaded from the following links: eBird Basic Dataset: https://github.com/mstrimas/ebp-workshop/raw/master/raw-data/ebd_relApr-2019_workshop.tar Sampling Event Data: https://github.com/mstrimas/ebp-workshop/raw/master/raw-data/ebd_sampling_relApr-2019_workshop.tar This subset contains data from Yucatan Peninsula (Guatemala, Belize, and five Mexican sates) from 2015-2016. The files will be in .tar format, and should be unarchived. The resulting directories will contain files with extension .txt.gz, these files should be uncompressed (on Windows use 7-Zip, on Mac use the default system uncompression utility) to produce two text files (ebd_relApr-2019_workshop.txt and ebd_sampling_relApr-2019_workshop.txt). Move these files to a sensible, central location on your computer. When working with the full dataset, the EBD will be over 200 GB! If this is too large to fit on your computer, it can be stored on an external hard drive. We’ll also talk later in the workshop about some ways of avoiding downloading the EBD. Checkpoint Are the files downloaded and unarchived into a central location? Let’s take a look at this dataset. If we were working with the full EBD, we wouldn’t have enough memory to read in the whole file, but we can always read a small subset. Open a new R script (01_ebrid-data.R) and read in the first few lines: library(readr) library(auk) ebd_top &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;~/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, n_max = 5) View this data frame within RStudio. Scroll over to the SAMPLING EVENT DATA column and note the value: S21914547. With this code we can access any non-private checklist via the website by appending it to https://ebird.org/view/checklist/. Look at the checklist online and compare it to the EBD. Notice three things that distiguish eBird data from other citizen science data: eBird collects data on the observation process, including the survey protocol used and effort information. This facilitates more robust analyses because we can account for variation in the observation process. Complete checklists enable non-detection to be inferred from the data. Without this, there’s no way to distinguish whether a species was not observered or just not reported. For these reasons, we refer to complete eBird checklists as semi-structured to distinguish from both most unstructured citizen science data and traditional structure scientific surveys. Exercise Take a few minutes to explore the EBD and compare it to the checklists online. Notice above that we had to reference the full path to the text files. In general, it’s best to avoid using absolute paths in R scripts because it makes them less portable–if you’re sharing the files with someone else, they’ll need to change the file paths to point to the location at which they’ve stored the eBird data. The R package auk provides a workaround for this, by allowing users to set an environment variable (EDB_PATH) that points to the directory where you’ve stored the eBird data. To set this variable, use the function auk_set_ebd_path(). For example, if the EBD and Sampling Event Data files are in ~/data/ebird/, use: auk_set_ebd_path(&quot;~/data/ebird/&quot;) The function auk_ebd() creates an R object referencing the EBD text file. Now that we’ve set up an EBD path, we can reference the EBD directly within auk_ebd() even though it’s not in our working directory. auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: all #&gt; Countries: all #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: all #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: all #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: no You should now see the EBD text file referenced as Input in this auk_ebd object. The remainder of the information printed will be the topic of the next section. Checkpoint Were you able to create an auk_ebd object from the EBD text? "],
["filter.html", "Lesson 4 Filtering 4.1 Defining filters 4.2 Execute filters", " Lesson 4 Filtering The EBD is huge, much too large to be read into R. So, if we want to work with these data, we first need to extract a small enough subset that it can be processed by R. This is the main purpose of the auk package: it uses the unix command line utility AWK to extract data from the EBD. There are three steps to this filtering process: Set up a reference to the EBD text file with auk_ebd(). Define a set of filters. Compile those filters into an AWK script and run it. Tip Filtering with auk can be fairly coarse, we just need to make the data small enough to read into R. Once the data are in R, they can be further subset. 4.1 Defining filters The types of filters that can be applied to the EBD fall into four categories: Species Region Season Protocol and effort Each specific filter is implemented by a different function in auk. Visit the documentation on filters on the auk website for a complete list. Each of these functions defines a filter on a column within the EBD. For example, auk_country() will define a filter allowing us to extract data from a subset of countries from the EBD. To define a filter, start by creating an auk_ebd object, then pipe this into one of the filtering functions. library(auk) auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;Guatemala&quot;) #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: all #&gt; Countries: GT #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: all #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: all #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: no Notice that when the auk_ebd object is printed, it tells us what filters have been defined. At this point, nothing has been done to the EBD, we’ve just defined the filter, we haven’t executed it yet. In general, you should think about filtering on region, season, and species, so let’s build upon what we already have and add some more filters. For example, if we wanted all Resplendant Quetzal records from Guatemala in June 2015 we would use the following filters: auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Resplendent Quetzal&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;Guatemala&quot;) %&gt;% auk_date(c(&quot;2015-06-01&quot;, &quot;2015-06-30&quot;)) #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: Pharomachrus mocinno #&gt; Countries: GT #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: 2015-06-01 - 2015-06-30 #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: all #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: no Tip The filtering functions in auk check the arguments you provide and will throw an error if there’s something wrong. Filtering the EBD takes a long time, so it’s better to get an error now rather than realizing you made a mistake after waiting several hours for the extraction process to complete. auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Resplendant Quetzal&quot;) #&gt; Error in auk_species.auk_ebd(., &quot;Resplendant Quetzal&quot;): The following species were not found in the eBird taxonomy: #&gt; Resplendant Quetzal auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_date(c(&quot;2016-06-01&quot;, &quot;2015-06-30&quot;)) #&gt; Error: date[1] not less than or equal to date[2] Exercise Define filters to extract Magnolia Warbler observations from Belize that are from checklists that started between 5 and 9 am and used either the Traveling or Stationary protocols. Consult the list of filters to see which ones you’ll need to use. Solution auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Magnolia Warbler&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;BZ&quot;) %&gt;% auk_protocol(c(&quot;Traveling&quot;, &quot;Stationary&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_time(c(&quot;5:00&quot;, &quot;9:00&quot;)) #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: Setophaga magnolia #&gt; Countries: BZ #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: all #&gt; Start time: 05:00-09:00 #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: Traveling, Stationary #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: no Tip In general, when using the effort filters like auk_time() or auk_distance(), it’s best to be quite coarse. You can always refine the filters later once the data are in R and starting with a coarse filter gives you some wiggle room if you later realize you want to make adjustments. Remember: the initial filtering with auk takes a long time, it’s best to limit the number of times you do this. When filtering by date, you may need to extract records from a given date range regardless of year. For the situation, the auk_date() function can accept wildcards for the year. For example, we can rewrite the above Resplendent Quetzal example to get observations from June of any year. auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Resplendent Quetzal&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;Guatemala&quot;) %&gt;% auk_date(c(&quot;*-06-01&quot;, &quot;*-06-30&quot;)) #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: Pharomachrus mocinno #&gt; Countries: GT #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: *-06-01 - *-06-30 #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: all #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: no 4.1.1 Complete checklists One of the most important filters is auk_complete(), which limits observations to those from complete checklists. As we’ve already seen, with complete checklists we can infer non-detections from the data. For most scientific applications, it’s critical that we have complete checklists, so we can generate presence/absence data. Exercise Define filters to extract Horned Guan and Highland Guan records from complete checklists in Chiapas, Mexico. Hint: you should use the auk_state() filter. Solution auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(c(&quot;Horned Guan&quot;, &quot;Highland Guan&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_state(&quot;MX-CHP&quot;) %&gt;% auk_complete() #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; Filters not executed #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: Oreophasis derbianus, Penelopina nigra #&gt; Countries: all #&gt; States: MX-CHP #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: all #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: all #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: yes Tip To find the state code, consult the ebird_states data frame or visit the Explore page on the eBird website and enter the state name under Explore Region. The state code will appear after region in the URL. For example, for Chiapas the URL is https://ebird.org/region/MX-CHP?yr=all and the state code is therefore MX-CHP. 4.2 Execute filters Once you have an auk_ebd object with a set of filters defined you can execute those filters with auk_filter(). This function compiles the filters into an AWK script, then executes that script to produce a text file with the defined subset of the EBD. We’ll store this output file within the data/ subdirectory of the project directory. Note that filtering on the full EBD will take at least a couple hours, so be prepared to wait awhile. ebd_filtered &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Yellow-rumped Warbler&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;GT&quot;) %&gt;% auk_protocol(c(&quot;Traveling&quot;, &quot;Stationary&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(file = &quot;data/ebd_yerwar.txt&quot;) ebd_filtered #&gt; Input #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/data/ebird/ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt #&gt; #&gt; Output #&gt; EBD: /Users/mes335/projects/ebp-workshop/data/ebd_yerwar.txt #&gt; #&gt; Filters #&gt; Species: Setophaga coronata #&gt; Countries: GT #&gt; States: all #&gt; BCRs: all #&gt; Bounding box: full extent #&gt; Date: all #&gt; Start time: all #&gt; Last edited date: all #&gt; Protocol: Traveling, Stationary #&gt; Project code: all #&gt; Duration: all #&gt; Distance travelled: all #&gt; Records with breeding codes only: no #&gt; Complete checklists only: yes Notice that we’ve drastically reduced the size of the file and it can now be imported into R without any issues. Checkpoint Any questions on filtering? "],
["import.html", "Lesson 5 Importing Data 5.1 Group checklists 5.2 Taxonomy", " Lesson 5 Importing Data In the previous lesson we extracted a subset of the EBD containing Yellow-rumped Warbler observations from Guatemala. The output file created by auk_filter() is a tab-seperated text file and could be read into using read.delim() or readr::read_tsv(); however, auk has a function specifically for reading the EBD. read_ebd() does the following: Reads the data using data.table::fread(), which is much faster than read.delim(). Sets the correct variable types. Cleans up the column names so they are all snake_case. Automatically performs some post processing steps, which will be covered later in this lesson.

Does anyone have any questions about the data so far? 5.1 Group checklists eBird allows users to share checklists with other eBird users that they’re birding with. This results it multiple copies of some checklists in the database. Group checklists can be identified in the data because they have the group_identifier populated. Let’s take a look at these checklists. filter(ebd, !is.na(group_identifier)) %&gt;% select(sampling_event_identifier, group_identifier) %&gt;% head() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 2 #&gt; sampling_event_identifier group_identifier #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 S26466410 G1514667 #&gt; 2 S26466240 G1514667 #&gt; 3 S26467913 G1514667 #&gt; 4 S26033869 G1480977 #&gt; 5 S26467907 G1514670 #&gt; 6 S26064931 G1480977 We see that there are multiple checklists with the same group_identifier, implying that these checklists have been shared and are duplicates. Let’s look at one of these on the eBird website: https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S26466410 As it turns out, group checklists aren’t exact duplicates; once a checklist has been shared the individual checklists can diverge in terms of the species seen, the counts for each species, and even the protocol and effort. In most cases, you’ll only want to retain one of these checklists, but it’s not trivial to do so because the checklists are only partial duplicates. The function auk_unique() manages this for you. Specifically, for each species, it retains only the first observation of that species, which is typically the one submitted by the primary observer (i.e. the person who recorded the original checklist). keep_one &lt;- filter(ebd, group_identifier == &quot;G1480977&quot;) %&gt;% auk_unique() Note that a new field has been created (checklist_id), which is populated with group_identifier for group checklists and sampling_event_identifier otherwise; this is now a unique identifier for checklists. In addition, the full set of observer and sampling event identifiers has been retained in a comma seperated format. By default, read_ebd() calls auk_unique() automatically; however, this behaviour can be controlled with the unique argument. ebd &lt;- read_ebd(&quot;data/ebd_yerwar.txt&quot;, rollup = FALSE) Tip auk_unique() takes a long time to run on large datasets. Consider using read_ebd(unique = FALSE) when importing large text files to prevent R from freezing. 5.2 Taxonomy eBird users can enter data for a wide range of taxa in addition to species. Observations can be reported at a level more granular than species (e.g. subspecies or recognizable forms) or at a higher level than species (e.g. spuhs, slashes, and hybrids). All the different taxa that can be reported are contains in the eBird taxonomy, which is updated every year in August. The eBird Science page has a subsection with details on the eBir taxonomy and the taxonomy itself is available in the package as a dataframe in the auk package. glimpse(ebird_taxonomy) #&gt; Observations: 16,248 #&gt; Variables: 8 #&gt; $ scientific_name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Struthio camelus&quot;, &quot;Struthio molybdophanes&quot;, &quot;S… #&gt; $ common_name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Common Ostrich&quot;, &quot;Somali Ostrich&quot;, &quot;Common/Soma… #&gt; $ species_code &lt;chr&gt; &quot;ostric2&quot;, &quot;ostric3&quot;, &quot;y00934&quot;, &quot;grerhe1&quot;, &quot;lesr… #&gt; $ category &lt;chr&gt; &quot;species&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;slash&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;speci… #&gt; $ taxon_order &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 30, … #&gt; $ order &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Struthioniformes&quot;, &quot;Struthioniformes&quot;, &quot;Struthi… #&gt; $ family &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Struthionidae&quot;, &quot;Struthionidae&quot;, &quot;Struthionidae… #&gt; $ report_as &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;lesrhe2&quot;, &quot;lesrhe2&quot;, NA, NA… Note that for taxa below the species level, the report_as field specifies the species that this taxa falls under. The EBD contains a subspecies column which is populated when an observer has identified a bird below species level. In the EBD extract we’re working with, we have three different subspecies of Yellow-rumped Warbler: count(ebd, common_name, subspecies_common_name) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 3 #&gt; common_name subspecies_common_name n #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Yellow-rumped Warbler &lt;NA&gt; 59 #&gt; 2 Yellow-rumped Warbler Yellow-rumped Warbler (Audubon&#39;s) 38 #&gt; 3 Yellow-rumped Warbler Yellow-rumped Warbler (Goldman&#39;s) 14 #&gt; 4 Yellow-rumped Warbler Yellow-rumped Warbler (Myrtle) 12 It’s even possible to have multiple subspecies of the same species on a single checklist. filter(ebd, checklist_id == &quot;S22725024&quot;) %&gt;% select(checklist_id, common_name, subspecies_common_name, observation_count) #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 4 #&gt; checklist_id common_name subspecies_common_name observation_cou… #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 S22725024 Yellow-rumped Wa… Yellow-rumped Warbler (M… 1 #&gt; 2 S22725024 Yellow-rumped Wa… Yellow-rumped Warbler (A… 1 For most uses, you’ll want eBird data at the species level, which means dropping higher level taxa and rolling lower level taxa up to species level, making sure to sum the counts if multiple subspecies were present.

["presabs.html", "Lesson 6 Presence-absence Data 6.1 Filtering 6.2 Zero-filling 6.3 Tidying up", " Lesson 6 Presence-absence Data Up to this point we’ve been working with presence-only data. The EBD, and eBird checklist in general, only explicitly record positive observations of species. However, if we limit ourselves to complete checklists, we can fill in the implied zero counts for any checklists on which a given species isn’t explicitly reported to presence-absence data. We refer to this process as zero-filling the eBird data. Zero-filling relies on the Sampling Event Data, which is a tab-seperated text file containing checklist-level information. This file contains the full population of checklists in the eBird database. If we apply exactly the same set of filters to both the EBD and the Sampling Event Data we can assume that any checklist with no observations for a given species in the EBD should get a zero-count record added to the dataset. So, producing Presence-absence eBird data is a two-step process: Simultaneously filter the EBD and Sampling Event Data, making sure to only use complete checklists. Read both files into R and zero-fill the EBD using the full population of checklists from the Sampling Event Data. Tip When we say “presence-absence” what we really mean by absence is that the species was not detected, it’s entirely possible that the species was presented but the observer didn’t detect it. 6.1 Filtering Simultaneously filtering the EBD and Sampling Event Data is done in almost the exact same way as filtering the EBD alone. The only difference is that we provide both files to auk_ebd() and two corresponding output files to auk_filter(). For example, we can extract all American Flamingo observations from January in the Mexican state of Yucatán in preparation for zero-filling: library(auk) library(dplyr) f_ebd &lt;- &quot;data/ebd_amefla.txt&quot; f_sed &lt;- &quot;data/sed_amefla.txt&quot; ebd_filt &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, file_sampling = &quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;American Flamingo&quot;) %&gt;% auk_state(&quot;MX-YUC&quot;) %&gt;% auk_date(c(&quot;*-01-01&quot;, &quot;*-01-31&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(f_ebd, file_sampling = f_sed) We now have two output files that have been extract using the same set of filters, apart from the species filter, which only applies to the EBD. We can read these files into R individually: ebd_only &lt;- read_ebd(f_ebd) sed_only &lt;- read_sampling(f_sed) n_distinct(ebd_only$checklist_id) #&gt; [1] 51 n_distinct(sed_only$checklist_id) #&gt; [1] 336 So, we have 336 checklists in the Sampling Event Data and, of those, 51 have Ocellated Turkey observations on them. Exercise You’re studying Hooded Warblers wintering (November-February) in Belize. Extract eBird data in preparation for zero-filling, then read in the results and explore them. Hint: consult the Details section of the documentation for auk_date() to see how to filter a range of dates that wrap around the year end. Solution f_ebd_hw &lt;- &quot;data/ebd_hoowar.txt&quot; f_sed_hw &lt;- &quot;data/sed_hoowar.txt&quot; ebd_filt &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, file_sampling = &quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Hooded Warbler&quot;) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;BZ&quot;) %&gt;% # when using wildcards, dates can wrap around the year end auk_date(c(&quot;*-11-01&quot;, &quot;*-02-29&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(f_ebd_hw, file_sampling = f_sed_hw) # import the data ebd_only_hw &lt;- read_ebd(f_ebd_hw) sed_only_hw &lt;- read_sampling(f_sed_hw) 6.2 Zero-filling Now that we have these two datasets, containing checklist and species information, we can use the function auk_zerofill() to combine them to produce presence-absence data. This function also imports the data and handles group checklists and taxonomic rollup automatically, we just have to pass it the paths to the two files. Let’s do this with the American Flamingo data. ebd_zf &lt;- auk_zerofill(f_ebd, sampling_events = f_sed) ebd_zf #&gt; Zero-filled EBD: 336 unique checklists, for 1 species. By default, auk_zerofill() returns the data as a list of two dataframes: sampling_events contains all the checklist and observations contains just the counts and presence-absence data for each species on each checklist. This compact format reduces the size of the data because checklist information isn’t replicated for every species observation. glimpse(ebd_zf$observations) #&gt; Observations: 336 #&gt; Variables: 4 #&gt;

$ species_observed &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALS… Notice that in addition to the observation_count column, we now have a binary species_observered column specifying whether or not the species was observered on this checklist. You can also automatically collapse the data by using the collapse = TRUE argument to auk_zerofill(). Exercise Zero-fill and collapse the Hooded Warbler data you extracted in the previous exercise. Solution ebd_zf_hw &lt;- auk_zerofill(f_ebd_hw, f_sed_hw) Tip Whenever you’re zero-filling data it’s critical that you think about region and season (i.e. where and when) in addition to just the species. If you don’t do that, you’ll zero-fill the entire global EBD and your computer will explode. For example, consider a highly localized species like the Cozumel Vireo, endemic to the small island of Cozumel off the coast of Mexico. Let’s try just filtering on species. ebd_cozvir &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, file_sampling = &quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Cozumel Vireo&quot;) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(&quot;data/ebd_cozvir.txt&quot;, &quot;data/sed_cozvir.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_zerofill(collapse = TRUE) table(ebd_cozvir$species_observed) #&gt; #&gt; FALSE TRUE #&gt; 35487 127 What we have here is the entire EBD (36 million checklists!) for a species that only occurs on one small island. In this situation, you would be better to identify the boundaries of the island and use auk_bbox() to spatially subset the data. ebd_cozvir &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, file_sampling = &quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(&quot;Cozumel Vireo&quot;) %&gt;% # lng_min, lat_min, lng_max, lat_max auk_bbox(c(-87.12, 20.25, -86.68, 20.63)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(&quot;data/ebd_cozvir.txt&quot;, &quot;data/sed_cozvir.txt&quot;, overwrite = TRUE) %&gt;% auk_zerofill(collapse = TRUE) table(ebd_cozvir$species_observed) #&gt; #&gt; FALSE TRUE #&gt; 744 127 We have the same number of positive observations, but have now drastically reduced the number of checklists without Cozumel Vireo observations. 6.3 Tidying up We now have a zero-filled presence-absence dataset with duplicate group checklists removed and all observations at the species level. There are couple remaining steps that we typically run to clean up the data. First, you may have noticed some cases where observation_count is &quot;X&quot; in the data. This is what eBirders enter for the count to indicate that they didn’t count the number of individuals for a given species. arrange(ebd_zf_df, desc(observation_count)) %&gt;% select(checklist_id, observation_count) %&gt;% head(10) #&gt; # A tibble: 10 x 2 #&gt; checklist_id observation_count #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 S27259643 X #&gt; 2 G1546995 X #&gt; 3 G1533133 85 #&gt; 4 G1120861 8 #&gt; 5 G1140974 8 #&gt; 6 G1141753 690 #&gt; # … with 4 more rows It’s more appropriate to have this as NA rather than &quot;X&quot; and this will also allow us to convert the count column data type to integer rather than character. At this point, we’ll also assign an explicit distance of 0 to stationary checklists. zf_count &lt;- ebd_zf_df %&gt;% mutate(observation_count = if_else(observation_count == &quot;X&quot;, NA_character_, observation_count), observation_count = as.integer(observation_count), effort_distance_km = if_else(protocol_type == &quot;Stationary&quot;, 0, effort_distance_km)) Finally, depending on your application, you’ll likely want to do some further filtering of the data. For many uses, it’s a good idea to reduce the variation in detectability between checklists by imposing some constraints on the effort variables. For example, in part II of this workshop, we’ll restrict observations to those from checklists less than 5 hours long and 5 km in length, and with 10 or fewer observers. zf_effort &lt;- zf_count %&gt;% filter(duration_minutes &lt;= 60 * 5, effort_distance_km &lt;= 5, number_observers &lt;= 10) table(zf_count$species_observed) #&gt; #&gt; FALSE TRUE #&gt; 285 51 table(zf_effort$species_observed) #&gt; #&gt; FALSE TRUE #&gt; 264 24 We’ve reduced the amount of data, but also decreased the variability in effort, which will lead to better model performance if we use these data to model species distributions.

We’ll start by summarizing the data to show the trajectory of observation frequency over the course of the year. Next, we’ll make a basic presence-absence map of eBird observations. More advanced topics are covered in part II of this workshop, which focuses on using eBird data to model species distributions. 7.1 Frequency trajectories The genus Cardellina contains five New World warbler species, including some of the most spectacular birds in North America: Canada Warbler, Red Warbler, and Pink-headed Warbler. Let’s extract and zero-fill data for these three species in this genus within Guatemala. library(auk) library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) library(lubridate) library(tidyverse) f_ebd &lt;- &quot;data/ebd_cardellina.txt&quot; f_sed &lt;- &quot;data/sed_cardellina.txt&quot; # extract filters &lt;- auk_ebd(&quot;ebd_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;, file_sampling = &quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_species(c(&quot;Canada Warbler&quot;, &quot;Wilson&#39;s Warbler&quot;, &quot;Pink-headed Warbler&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_country(&quot;Guatemala&quot;) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(f_ebd, f_sed) # zero-fill cardellina_zf &lt;- auk_zerofill(f_ebd, f_sed, collapse = TRUE) count(cardellina_zf, scientific_name, species_observed) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; scientific_name species_observed n #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Cardellina canadensis FALSE 9058 #&gt; 2 Cardellina canadensis TRUE 93 #&gt; 3 Cardellina pusilla FALSE 6676 #&gt; 4 Cardellina pusilla TRUE 2475 #&gt; 5 Cardellina versicolor FALSE 8855 #&gt; 6 Cardellina versicolor TRUE 296 Next, let’s summarize these data, calculating the frequency of observation on eBird checklists by month. cardellina_freq &lt;- cardellina_zf %&gt;% mutate(month = month(observation_date)) %&gt;% group_by(scientific_name, month) %&gt;% summarize(obs_freq = mean(species_observed)) %&gt;% ungroup() In prepartion for plotting, we can add the common names of the species by joining in the ebird_taxonomy data frame, which is included with auk. In addition, we’ll convert the integer month numbers to dates–using the midpoint of each month–to aid axis labelling. cardellina_comm &lt;- cardellina_freq %&gt;% inner_join(ebird_taxonomy, by = &quot;scientific_name&quot;) %&gt;% select(common_name, month, obs_freq) %&gt;% mutate(month_midpoint = ymd(str_glue(&quot;2019-{month}-15&quot;))) Finally, let’s make a frequency trajectory for these four species. ggplot(cardellina_comm) + aes(x = month_midpoint, y = obs_freq, color = common_name) + geom_point() + geom_line() + scale_x_date(date_breaks = &quot;2 months&quot;, date_labels = &quot;%b&quot;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Month&quot;, y = &quot;Observation Frequency&quot;, color = NULL) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) We have several different patterns going on here: Pink-headed Warblers is resident species, present year-round at fairly low abundance Wilson’s Warbler is a migrant, spending the winter in Guatemala and is common during that period Canada Warbler appears to only pass through Guatemala during migration 7.2 Maps Continuing with the same dataset, let’s make a presence-absence map for Pink-headed Warbler. Let’s start by filtering the zero-filled data to only Pink-headed Warbler observations and converting these points to a spatial format using the sf package. pihwar &lt;- cardellina_zf %&gt;% filter(scientific_name == &quot;Cardellina versicolor&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(pres_abs = if_else(species_observed, &quot;Present&quot;, &quot;Not detected&quot;)) %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;), crs = 4326) Next, we’ll use rnaturalearth to get some contextual GIS data to use in our maps.

There are lots excellent tools for mapping in R; however, here we’ll use the basic plot() function from the sf package. par(mar = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)) plot(ne_gt, col = NA, border = NA) plot(ne_country, col = &quot;grey80&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;, add = TRUE) plot(ne_gt, col = &quot;grey70&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;, add = TRUE) # not observed pihwar_abs &lt;- filter(pihwar, !species_observed) %&gt;% st_geometry() plot(pihwar_abs, col = alpha(&quot;grey20&quot;, 0.3), pch = 19, cex = 0.25, add = TRUE) # present pihwar_pres &lt;- filter(pihwar, species_observed) %&gt;% st_geometry() plot(pihwar_pres, col = alpha(&quot;orange&quot;, 1), pch = 19, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE) title(&quot;Pink-headed Warbler eBird Observations&quot;, line = -1) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;, col = c(&quot;grey20&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), legend = c(&quot;Not reported&quot;, &quot;Present&quot;), pch = 19) box() Within Guatemala, Pink-headed Warbler is restricted to the southwestern highlands of Guatemala.

["advanced.html", "Lesson 8 Advanced Topics 8.1 Custom downloads 8.2 Preparing for occupancy modeling 8.3 Reducing file size 8.4 Land cover covariates", " Lesson 8 Advanced Topics 8.1 Custom downloads The full EBD is massive (over 200 GB) and takes a long time to process with auk (typically several hours). In some cases, there is a way around these issues. On the EBD download page, there is a Custom Download form that allows you to only download a subset of the EBD for a given species, within a region, and for a range of dates. After submitting this form, the request will be processed on the eBird servers and a email will be sent to you with instructions for downloading the EBD extract. Recall from the lesson on zero-filling, that we extracted American Flamingo records from Mexico’s Yucatán state in January, and produced presence-absence data from this extract. Let’s try to do this with the Custom Download form. After the request is submitted an email will arrive with instrustions for downloading the following file. Download and unarchive this file, placing the text file in the data/ subdirectory of your project. tf &lt;- &quot;data/temp.zip&quot; download.file(&quot;https://github.com/mstrimas/ebp-workshop/raw/master/raw-data/ebd_MX-YUC_grefla2_201501_201612_relApr-2019.zip&quot;, tf) unzip(tf, &quot;ebd_MX-YUC_grefla2_201501_201612_relApr-2019.txt&quot;, exdir = &quot;data/&quot;) unlink(tf) It will quickly become clear that there are two issues with this approach. First, the set of filters available in the Custom Download form is limited. For example, there’s no option to only extract observations from complete checklists or any way to get observations from a given month from any year. To address this, we can apply the additional filters after we’ve imported the data in R. Specifically, we’ll only keep observations from complete checklists in June. library(auk) library(lubridate) library(tidyverse) ebd &lt;- read_ebd(&quot;data/ebd_MX-YUC_grefla2_201501_201612_relApr-2019.txt&quot;) %&gt;% filter(month(observation_date) == 1, all_species_reported) The second challenge is that the Custom Download form only provides the positive observations from the EBD, it doesn’t provide the corresponding Sampling Event Data for zero-filling. However, the Sampling Event Data is much smaller than the EBD and quicker to process. So, we can easily filter this file using the same set of filters we’ve already applied to the EBD. Note that auk_sampling() is used in place of auk_ebd() when we’re only filtering the sampling data and not the EBD. f_sed &lt;- &quot;data/sed-only_amefla.txt&quot; sed_filt &lt;- auk_sampling(&quot;ebd_sampling_2015-2016_yucatan.txt&quot;) %&gt;% auk_state(&quot;MX-YUC&quot;) %&gt;% auk_date(c(&quot;*-01-01&quot;, &quot;*-01-31&quot;)) %&gt;% auk_complete() %&gt;% auk_filter(&quot;data/sed-only_amefla.txt&quot;) sed &lt;- read_sampling(f_sed) Finally, we can join these combine those two dataframes together with auk_zerofill() to produce zero-filled presence-absence data. ebd_zf &lt;- auk_zerofill(ebd, sed, collapse = TRUE) We’ve produced exactly the same data as in Lesson 6; however, we’ve done so avoiding having to deal with the full EBD. 8.2 Preparing for occupancy modeling One common use of eBird data is for occupancy modeling with the R package unmarked. This workshop won’t cover occupancy modeling; however, unmarked requires data to be formatted in a very particular way and auk contains functions to prepare data in this way, which we’ll cover in this lesson. We’ll continue with the American Flamingo data from the previous section. First, we need to extract the subset of observations that are suitable for occupancy modeling. In particular, occupancy models typically require data from repeated sampling events to a single site during a time frame over which the population can be considered closed. For example, let’s define the period of closure as the entire month of January in each year and a repeat visit as the same observer revisting a site with same latitude and longitude at least twice. The auk function filter_repeat_visits() is designed to extract a subset of eBird data of this form. visits &lt;- filter_repeat_visits(ebd_zf, min_obs = 2, max_obs = 10, annual_closure = TRUE, date_var = &quot;observation_date&quot;, site_vars = c(&quot;latitude&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;observer_id&quot;)) # entire data set nrow(visits) #&gt; [1] 112 # reduced data set nrow(ebd_zf) #&gt; [1] 336 # how many individual sites there are n_distinct(visits$site) #&gt; [1] 39 Three new columns are added to the dataset when using the function filter_repeat_visits(): site is a unique site ID, closure_id identifies the primary period of closure (in this example the year), and n_observations is the number of visits to each site. Now that we have data suitable for occupancy modeling, we need to reformat the data to be accepted by unmarked. The documentation for the unmarked function formatWide() outlines the details of this format. In the EBD, each row is a checklist; however, unmarked requires each row to be a site with the first column specifying the site ID and subsequent columns specifying whether the species was observed on each of the visits to that site. The next group of columns contains site-level covariates, those that vary between sites but are constant across visits to the same site, such as latitude, longitude, and habitat covariates. Finally, there are several groups of columns containing observation-level covariates, such as distance and duration. Each covariate gets a set of columns corresponding to the columns specifying the presence-absence of the species. The auk function format_unmarked_occu() takes care of the reformatting for you. response is the variable that you will be using as the response in occupancy modeling (e.g. observation_count or species_observered), site_covs are the site-level covariates, and obs_covs are the observation-level covariates. visits_um &lt;- format_unmarked_occu(visits, site_id = &quot;site&quot;, response = &quot;species_observed&quot;, site_covs = c(&quot;latitude&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;), obs_covs = c(&quot;time_observations_started&quot;, &quot;duration_minutes&quot;, &quot;effort_distance_km&quot;, &quot;number_observers&quot;, &quot;protocol_type&quot;)) Exercise Explore both the visits_um and visits dataframes. They contain the same data in different formats. Try to understand how one dataframe was transformed into the other. 8.3 Reducing file size 8.4 Land cover covariates "]
